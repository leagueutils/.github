# League Utils
This GitHub organization is the home of all the code that makes the League Utils
[Discord bot](https://leagueutils.com/bot-invite), our [website](https://leagueutils.com) and our 
[API](https://api.leagueutils.com/docs) work. For more information on who we are and what we do, feel free to browse the
website or join our [Discord server](https://leagueutils.com/support-server), but in short: League Utils is a
Discord-based platform to host Clash of Clans tournaments on. Development started on December 8th, 2019, and with a few
summer breaks, has continuously progressed since then. The result is an iompressive 50k+ lines of code and  arguably the
most fully-featured Discord bot Clash of Clans Esports has ever seen. The website and API further extend the platform,
and we have no plans of stopping anytime soon.

## Tech Stack
League Utils is primarily built in Python. The Discord bot and backend are pure Python, but there are plans to add a
tiny bit of rust into the mix in the future. The API is built using the amazing FastAPI package, and the website is
built with Django, custom CSS and a few basic JavaScript functions.

## Supporting Our Work
If you want to financially support what we are doing (which you absolutely don't have to, and arguably shouldn't -
you are feeding an unhealthy coding habit), our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/leagueutils) is the best place to
do so.

### An apology
Sorry for how barebones this README is. I'll make it look good one day, I promise.
